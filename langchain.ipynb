It starts with the first element in the list, assigns that value to the variable \"number\", and then executes the code block within the loop (which is to print the current number). After executing the code block, it moves to the next element in the list, assigns that value to the variable \"number\", and executes the code block again. This process repeats until all elements in the list have been iterated over.\n",
